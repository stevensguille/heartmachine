# heartmachine controller 
The Heart Machine debuted at Burning Man in 2010, presenting a sophisticated fusion of concept, interactivity, aesthetics and amusement to the citizens of the city. The piece is comprised of a large sculpture of a robotic, but recognizably human-shaped, heart surrounded by four 16′ pillars, or “arteries,” that display light effects and emit 25’ columns of fire when activated.

This is the codebase for the Atmega 328p based controllers.  24 controllers (4 arms of 6 controllers) were networked over CanBus to a centralized Java/Linux host.  
Each controller had 3 touch sensitive pads and supported gestures using motion and proximity.  Each controller also had 16 RGB leds to implement the attractor and game lighting effects.
