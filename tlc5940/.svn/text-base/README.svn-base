tlc5940 <koniho@gmail.com>

A simple test of the tlc5940 interface for the node board for The Heart Machine
project (http://URL?)

There are number of modes that the demo can operate in. Modes can be modified
via the serial console. The tlc5940 module is written by Alex Leone
<acleone ~AT~ gmail.com> with a few modifications to the main file Tlc5940.cpp
to un-c++ the interface.

From the tlc5940 usage:

tlc5940_test: usage:
Commands take the form: CMD [VAL1] .... [VALN]
All commands are terminated with a '\r' character where
CMD is one of the following single characters:

    m - Set mode of TLC behavior
        s <mode>
        Valid modes are:
          p - pulsate (var: speed)
          s - static
          r - random
          w - random walk (doesn't really work)
          t - twinkle  (var: speed)

    s - Set value of a specific TLC Channel
        s <channel> <value>
        Note: This will put the TLC in static mode.

    t - Enable/Disable the TLC5940 Pseudo Chip Select
        t <value>
        0: disables chip select, otherwise enabled

    f - Set the number format used to parse numerical command arguments
        f <d|o|u|x>
        d: signed decimal
        o: octal
        u: unsigned decimal
        x: hexidecimal

    k - Set the output mask. All outputs will be filtered through
        this mask to determine if the channel should be on or not.
        k <hex_mask>

    e - Set rx echo
        e <0|1>
        0: disables local echo
        1: enables local echo

    t - Toggle the tlc5940 pseudo chip-select.
