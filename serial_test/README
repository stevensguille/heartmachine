stream_test <koniho@gmail.com>

A simple program to test the stdout/stdin mapping to USART Transmit and Receive
functions. This test should be used to test the USART functionality of the 
Heart Machine board.

Mostly borrowed from avr-libc stdio example.

Connections (taken from The Heart Machine board schematic):

FTDI-HEADER     CONNECTED-TO

1               GND 
2               -
3               Vcc
4 (TXD)         PORTD1 (TXD)
5 (RXD)         PORTD0 (RXD)
6 (RESET)       PORTC6 (RESET)

NOTE: Schematic has been changed since. Need to update
