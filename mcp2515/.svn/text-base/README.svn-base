mcp2515_test <koniho@gmail.com>

A simple loopback test for the mcp2515 using an AVR. The mcp2515 portion of
the code is written by Martin Thomas <eversmith@heizung-thomas.de> whose
copyright is included in the relevant files. A number of small modifications
have been made to support the atmega238p using the connections listed below.

Connections (taken from The Heart Machine board schematic):

MCP-PIN     SIGNAL      CONNECTED-TO

1           TXCAN       -
2           RXCAN       -
3           CLKOUT      -
4           ~TX0RTS     -
5           ~TX1RTS     -
6           ~TX2RTS     -
7           OSC2        GND
8           OSC1        PORTB0 (CKOUT)
9           V_SS        GND
10          ~RX1BF      -
11          ~RX0BF      -
12          ~INT        PORTD2 (CANINT)
13          SCK         PORTB5 (SCLK)
14          SI          PORTB3 (MOSI)
15          SO          PORTB4 (MISO)
16          ~CS         PORTD6 (CSCAN)
17          ~RESET      V_cc
18          V_DD        V_cc

The program runs in a continuous loop that will generate CAN messages of random
identifier, a random payload length, and random data for the payload. Transmit
and Receive results are output via rs232 at 57600 baud.

NOTE: the ~INT signal is not yet respected on the AVR.

TODO: Add GPIO functionality to twiddle LEDS on TX, RX.
